You can find the description of the project in this page: http://mahermanoubi.com/?page_id=23

Background: this was my very first software project so itâ€™s not probably the best in terms of implementation and coding techniques but it was a great start.

Problem: If you are a webmaster and want to promote your website, you find it sometimes hard to monitor how well your website is doing in search engines results.
